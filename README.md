nginx_certbot_dash_scrapy<br>

This docker-compose project is designed to streamline the process of building a multicontainer project where for example a scraper is collecting data at regular intervals whcih is then being visualized on a dash/flask website with full ssl encryption.

The way I designed this project you only need to change the domain name and email address variables essentially to get the docker running for your specific domain.
